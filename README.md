# [victor.horse](http://victor.horse)

Built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. Created for 2018's #May1Reboot event to showcase my most recent work.

## Content Structure

| Directory |  |
| --- | --- |
| ````_work/```` | Portfolio projects. |
| ````pages/```` | Site content. |
| ````media/```` | Images, pdfs, and other misc static content. |

### Blog Posts

**Blog posts can be easily edited and managed online via http://prose.io/#user/repo.**

Put published posts in ````_work```` and unpublished posts in ````_drafts````.

The first part of the file starts & ends with three dashes. This is your yaml configuration.

Then comes the markdown. Cheatsheet here: https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

You can start typing content here. <b>HTML is supported</b> and so is **markdown syntax.**
Try to use bold text and refrain from using _italics_ whenever possible.

Below are your headers, use them sparingly.

## Header 2

### Header 3

Images are pretty easy.

![Image description for screen readers go here: Fluffle Puff!](/media/guests/flufflepuff-avatar.png)

So are links: [Click here for Google!](http://google.com/)

> I am a quote
> - Maud Pie

You can make tables too, if you're inclined.

| Column Header 1 | Column Header 2 |
| -- | -- |
| Hi! | You get the point |
| Yo! | What's up? |

Lists are easy, just number or bullet them appropriately, like this:

- Item 1
- Item 2

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

You can embed anything by copying and pasting an embed code:
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMFWc_FMhqs"
frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

````

### Pages

Like posts, but also supports markdown ````.md```` or html ````.html````. I reccomend using html.

````markdown
---
layout: page # page (default) or blank (have to manually define container and content areas)
title: Philadelphia
subtitle: A guide to the City of Brother Love! # optional
permalink: /philly/
redirect_from: /philadelphia/ # optional if you are redireccting from an old url
cover: # may be used in the future
---

Start typing content here!

## Running the site locally

Make sure you have ruby installed, then...

````bash

# install gems (first time only)
bundle install

# run server on localhost:4000. SCSS and page content compiled automatically on save.
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 4000 --watch --incremental
````
